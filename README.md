This project is a simple Express app that connects to a MongoDB database hosted on Atlas to manage users, posts, and comments. It includes RESTful API routes for creating, retrieving, and managing these resources. The server is built using JavaScript with Express and Mongoose to interact with the database, and ReqBin is used to test the API. The goal of this project was to practice setting up a backend with MongoDB, building schemas for each resource, and ensuring the data flows smoothly from the API to the database. It was an awesome opportunity to get hands-on experience with Express, MongoDB, and working with real-time data!
